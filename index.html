    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>This model begins on the first year of Nabonassar, by Egyptian reckoning Thoth 1, mid-day. All things are in ratio that matter, but not all things are in ratio that could be.</p>
    
    <h2>Heavenly Bodies</h2>
    <h3>Mars</h3>
    <h4>Velocity</h4>
    <p>Calculation 9.3 finds that 37 anomalies of the star Mars fit in 79 solar years and 3;13 days (~79.0088 or 8657311/109574 years) in 42 revolutions of the star and 3;10 degrees (~45.16 or 271/6 revolutions). So the star on the epicycle completes 46.83% of a rotation in a year or makes 4054238 rotations in 8657311 years, while the epicycle on the deferent completes 57.17% of a rotation in a year or makes 14847277 rotations in 25971933 years.</p>
    <h4>Irregularity</h4>
    <p>Propositions 10.8-10.15 iteratively approach the eccentricity of the deferent, by the 3rd calculation, finding it to be 12 parts where the radius of the deferent is 60. So the eccentricity is 1/5th the deferent's radius.</p>
    <p>Proposition 10.20 determines the radius of the epicycle 39;30 (39.5) of the same parts. Thus the epicycle's radius is 39.5/60ths of the same above radius.</p>
    <h4>Epoch</h4>
    <p>Calculation 10.20 determines as follows: "for the first year of Nabonassar, by Egyptian reckoning Thoth 1, mid-day, as epoch ...: 3;32 degrees of Aries in longitude and 327;13 degrees from apogee of the epicycle in anomaly."</p>
    <p>But due to the motion of apogees, Mars' apogee has moved from 21;25 degrees of Cancer to 16;40 degrees of Cancer by this epoch.</p>
    
    <h3>The Sun</h3>
    <h4>Velocity</h4>
    <p>Calculation 3.14 determines the length of a year to be 365;14,48 (~365.246 or 54,787/150) days. That's also 8,765.92 hours, 525,955.2 minutes, or 31,557,312 seconds.</p>
    <h4>Irregularity</h4>
    <p>Calculation 3.20 determines the eccentricity to be 1/24th its radius.</p>
    <p>Calculation 3.21 determines the apogee to be 24;30 (24.5) degrees westwards of the summer tropic. That's also 5.5 degrees of the constellation Gemini.</p>
    <h4>Epoch</h4>
    <p>Observation 3.31 determines as follows: "in the first year of Nabonassar, by Egyptian reckoning Thoth 1, mid-day, the sun was separated from apogee eastwards in its uniform motion by 265;15 (265.25) degrees, and occupied in its mean motion 0;45 (0.75) degrees of Pisces."</p>
    
    <h3>Venus</h3>
    <h4>Velocity</h4>
    <p>Calculation 9.4 finds that 5 anomalies of the star Venus fit in 8 solar years less 2;18 days.</p>
    <h4>Irregularity</h4>
    <p>Calculations 10.1-2 and 10.3-4 both determine apogee to be 25 degrees of Taurus, which, relative to the summer tropic, is 45 degrees westwards.</p>
    <p>Proposition 10.2 determines the eccentricity of the deferent to be 1;15 (1.25) parts where the radius of the deferent is 60. So the eccentricity is 1.25/60ths of the deferent's radius.</p>
    <p>Proposition 10.2 further determines the radius of the epicycle to be 43;10 (43.16 or 259/6) of the same parts. Thus the epicycle's radius is 259/360ths of the same above radius.</p>
    <h4>Epoch</h4>
    <p>Calculation 10.13 determines as follows: "as epoch for the 1st year of Nabonassar, by Egyptian reckoning Thoth 1, mid-day: 71;7 (71.116 or 4267/60) degrees of anomaly from apogee of the epicycle; the mean passage of its longitude is assumed equal, again, to that of the sun, that is to say, occupying 0;45 degrees of Pisces."</p>
    <p>But due to the motion of apogees, Venus' apogee has moved to 16;10 degrees of Taurus by this epoch.</p>
