    <h3>Mars</h3>
    <h4>Velocity</h4>
    <p>Calculation 9.3 finds that 37 anomalies of the star Mars fit in 79 solar years and 3;13 days (~79.0088 or 8657311/109574 years) in 42 revolutions of the star and 3;10 degrees (~45.16 or 271/6 revolutions). So the star on the epicycle completes 46.83% of a rotation in a year or makes 4054238 rotations in 8657311 years, while the epicycle on the deferent completes 57.17% of a rotation in a year or makes 14847277 rotations in 25971933 years.</p>
    <h4>Irregularity</h4>
    <p>Propositions 10.8-10.15 iteratively approach the eccentricity of the deferent, by the 3rd calculation, finding it to be 12 parts where the radius of the deferent is 60. So the eccentricity is 1/5th the deferent's radius.</p>
    <p>Proposition 10.20 determines the radius of the epicycle 39;30 (39.5) of the same parts. Thus the epicycle's radius is 39.5/60ths of the same above radius.</p>
    <h4>Epoch</h4>
    <p>Calculation 10.20 determines as follows: "for the first year of Nabonassar, by Egyptian reckoning Thoth 1, mid-day, as epoch ...: 3;32 degrees of Aries in longitude and 327;13 degrees from apogee of the epicycle in anomaly."</p>
    <p>But due to the motion of apogees, Mars' apogee has moved from 21;25 degrees of Cancer to 16;40 degrees of Cancer by this epoch.</p>
    
    <h3>The Sun</h3>
    <h4>Velocity</h4>
    <p>Calculation 3.14 determines the length of a year to be 365;14,48 (~365.246 or 54,787/150) days. That's also 8,765.92 hours, 525,955.2 minutes, or 31,557,312 seconds.</p>
    <h4>Irregularity</h4>
    <p>Calculation 3.20 determines the eccentricity to be 1/24th its radius.</p>
    <p>Calculation 3.21 determines the apogee to be 24;30 (24.5) degrees westwards of the summer tropic. That's also 5.5 degrees of the constellation Gemini.</p>
    <h4>Epoch</h4>
    <p>Observation 3.31 determines as follows: "in the first year of Nabonassar, by Egyptian reckoning Thoth 1, mid-day, the sun was separated from apogee eastwards in its uniform motion by 265;15 (265.25) degrees, and occupied in its mean motion 0;45 (0.75) degrees of Pisces."</p>
    
    <h3>Venus</h3>
    <h4>Velocity</h4>
    <p>Calculation 9.4 finds that 5 anomalies of the star Venus fit in 8 solar years less 2;18 days.</p>
    <h4>Irregularity</h4>
    <p>Calculations 10.1-2 and 10.3-4 both determine apogee to be 25 degrees of Taurus, which, relative to the summer tropic, is 45 degrees westwards.</p>
    <p>Proposition 10.2 determines the eccentricity of the deferent to be 1;15 (1.25) parts where the radius of the deferent is 60. So the eccentricity is 1.25/60ths of the deferent's radius.</p>
    <p>Proposition 10.2 further determines the radius of the epicycle to be 43;10 (43.16 or 259/6) of the same parts. Thus the epicycle's radius is 259/360ths of the same above radius.</p>
    <h4>Epoch</h4>
    <p>Calculation 10.13 determines as follows: "as epoch for the 1st year of Nabonassar, by Egyptian reckoning Thoth 1, mid-day: 71;7 (71.116 or 4267/60) degrees of anomaly from apogee of the epicycle; the mean passage of its longitude is assumed equal, again, to that of the sun, that is to say, occupying 0;45 degrees of Pisces."</p>
    <p>But due to the motion of apogees, Venus' apogee has moved to 16;10 degrees of Taurus by this epoch.</p>
    
    <h3>Mars</h3>
    <p>Calc. 9.4: "37 anomalies of the star Mars fit exactly in 79 of our solar years and 3;13 days, most nearly, and in 42 revolutions of the star and 3;10 degrees." So its epicycle rotates 37 times in ~79.0088 years, 46.83% of a rotation per year, or precisely 4054238 rotations / 8657311 years. But in that time its deferent has rotated ~45.16 times, 57.17% of a rotation per year, or precisely 14806627 rotations / 25900833 years.</p>
    <p>Angle of Mars apogee where?</p>
    1: 21 degrees of Gemini
    2: 28;50 degrees of Leo
    3: 2;34 degrees of Sagittarius
    <p>Prop 10.15: "the straight line DI between the centers is 12 parts, most nearly, of which radius IJ of the eccentric circle is 60." The center of the deferent is a distance from the Earth 1/5, or 20%, of its radius.</p>
    <p>Prop 10.20: "the ratio of the radius of the eccentric circle to the radius of the epicycle is 60 to 39;30." The radius of the epicycle is 39.5/60ths, or about 65.83%, of the radius of the deferent.</p>
    <h3>The Sun</h3>
    <p>The Sun moves eastward over the course of 365;14,48 days on an eccentric circle.</p>
    <p>Calc. 3.20: "the radius of the eccentric circle is 24 times ... the line between its center and the center of the zodiac circle" can be understood as the eccentricity's relative radial coordinate; "arc BG, by which the point at apogee G is westwards of the summer tropic point B, is 24;30 degrees" can be understood as the eccentricity's angular coordinate. Thus its center is a distance from the Earth 1/24th its radius and 24.5 degrees west of the point of the summer tropic.</p>
    <h3>Venus</h3>
    <p>Calc. 9.4: "5 anomalies of the star Venus fit exactly in 8 of our solar years, less 2;18 days." That's 5 anomalies per ~7.9937 years, 62.55% of an anomaly per year, or precisely 273935 anomalies / 437951 years.</p>
    <p>Calc. 10.1-2: "since according to the earlier observation its mean passage occupied 14;15 degrees of Pisces, and according to the second 5;45 degrees of Leo, and the point midway between them on the mid-zodiac circle falls out about 25 degrees of Taurus and Scorpio, the diameter of its apogee and perigee would be along these points." Thus the angle of the deferent's eccentricity is 45 degrees in the same direction as that of the Sun..</p>
    <p>Calc. 10.3-4: "And the points of the mid-zodiac circle midway between 17;52 degrees of Libra and 2;4 degrees of Capricorn are about 25 degrees, most nearly, again of Scorpio and Taurus." Again, 45 degrees.</p>
    <p>Prop. 10.2: "straight line DE between the centers also will be 1;15, most nearly." The center of the deferent is a distance from the Earth very close to 1/48th, or 2.08%, of its radius.</p>
    <p>Prop. 10.2: "radius AF of the epicycle 43;10 parts where radius AD of the eccentric circle is 60." The radius of the epicycle is 259/360ths, or about 71.94%, of the radius of the deferent.</p>
